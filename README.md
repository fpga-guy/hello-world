# hello-world
This is a greeting to the whole entire planet earth.

Rationale:

1. I like people
2. I want people to like me
3. The earth needs more hello-ing

Thats it.

Well, maybe not everything. I suppose a few remarks about GIT may be in order.

* GIT is GOOD
* GIT is GREAT
* GIT is FANTASTIC

Okay. Enough.

# Goodbye-world
Presumably, this second commit, made locally on my Windows 7 virtual machine, will be the final one.

Only time will tell.
